# YeoPress

The officially un-official [Yeoman](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman) Generator for [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/).  I magically take you from scratching your head wondering where to start, all the way to running the famous 5-minute install.  I have configuration options that will WOW you.  If you use Git, I can *git* you off the ground with WordPress as a submodule just by following a couple of prompts.  Have a custom base theme you always start your projects off with?  You can install that to, either straight from GitHub or by pointing me to a tarball.  Other things I do:

- Custom directory configuration
- Install WordPress as a Git submodule for easy version controlled updates
- Theme init hook for when you install a new theme
- Permission setting on install
- Create your database, all you have to do is make me a user
- Built in Vagrant configuration
- *Coming Soon* Grunt tasks for some other WP tasks

## How To Use

If you do not already have the Yeoman toolset installed do so now, and might as well install me at the same time *(NOTE: don't type the `$`)*:

	$ npm install -g yo generator-wordpress

And run me:

	$ yo wordpress

Follow my prompts and WA-BAM....ASCII art!!!!

Newly added in version 1.0.4 is the `advanced` flag, which enables a few extra prompts.  These prompts allow you to use some extra features like the Vagrant integration and manually specifying the WP version.  To enable the advanced options run the generator like this:

	$ yo wordpress --advanced

## Themes

Custom themes can be installed from GitHub or a Tarball.  Once installed, they are responsible for their own Gruntfile and related tasks.  A basic example template can be found in the [template branch](https://github.com/wesleytodd/YeoPress/tree/template) of this repo.  The example template comes with a few grunt tasks pre-configured:

- Regarde ([grunt-regarde](https://npmjs.org/package/grunt-regarde))
- Live Reload ([grunt-contrib-livereload](https://npmjs.org/package/grunt-contrib-livereload))
- Sass ([grunt-contrib-sass](https://npmjs.org/package/grunt-contrib-sass))
- JSHint ([grunt-contrib-jshint](https://npmjs.org/package/grunt-contrib-jshint))
- Bower ([grunt-bower-requirejs](https://npmjs.org/package/grunt-bower-requirejs))
- RequireJS ([grunt-contrib-requirejs](https://npmjs.org/package/grunt-contrib-requirejs))
