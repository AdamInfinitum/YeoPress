# YeoPress

The officially un-official [Yeoman](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman) Generator for [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/).  I magically take you from scratching your head wondering where to start, all the way to running the famous 5-minute install.  While I am optimized for a workflow using Git, I have configuration options to WOW you.  If you do use Git, I can *git* you off the ground just by following a couple of prompts.  Have a custom base theme you always start your projects off with?  You can install that to, either stright from GitHub or by pointing me to a tarball.  Other things I do:

- Custom directory configuration
- Install WordPress as a Git submodule for easy version controled updates
- Theme init hooks for when you install a new theme
- Permission setting on install
- Grunt tasks for some down and dirty WP tasks

## How To Use

Install the generator:

	npm install generator-wordpress

Then in the directory you want to install WordPress:

	yo wordpress

Follow the prompts and WA-BAM!!!!
